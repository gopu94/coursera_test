	<p>
		we can't use < and > symbol in html,here it works because only of space in b/w them if no space html  will treat it as tags and ignored if unknown tag. so to use < and > we use & gt like &gt; and &lt; for  & use & amp like &amp; for non breaking space use its&nbsp;non&nbsp;breaking&nbsp;space. to get a content non changed in different charsets we use & quot like  &quot;content&quot;
