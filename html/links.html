			What's really neat about fragment identifiers is if you click on one and you have them in URL, you could copy and paste this URL and send it to a friend as a bookmark. And when they paste it into their browser, they will be taken to this page and jump straight to the section that was pointed to by the fragment identifier.

			 Now I am on my local hard drive, and I'm not on a server so obviously sending this link that points to my local hard drive is not going to do any good. But if we're on a server, this link with the section identifier would have taken anybody anywhere, with a connection to the internet, to the proper page and to the proper section of that page.

		<p> While fragment identifiers are very useful in order to jump to different parts of the same page, recently they have become even more important as they're used for navigation within the SPA or Single Page Applications. And SPA, Single Page Applications have become extremely popular. So knowing how fragment identifiers work is an important step towards being able to code single page applications.</p>
